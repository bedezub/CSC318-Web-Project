#MPP Uitm Jasin E-Voting

The e-vote system we are proposing here is a web based application for UiTM Cawangan Melaka Kampus Jasin’s internal use. The idea behind the creation of this system is to solve the problem of standard operational procedure that were used for voting before the Covid-19 global pandemic struck down, which required all students to be in a fixed place according to a specific time in schedule in order to collect the votes. Thus, the process requires a lot of time and effort. According to this problem statement, our group have come in one hand to simplify the problem by using a web based application called “e-vote system”. This system will not only become a modern solution but also a benchmark for UiTM Kampus Jasin in continuous enhancement of administration system in the future. Some of the benefits of this e-voting system will be in aiding the team in counting the ballots faster, reducing the cost of staff required to count votes manually while also providing more accessibility. Furthermore, results are also expected to be reported and published faster.
